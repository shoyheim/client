= Removing the Desktop Synchronization Client

== Windows Navigation Sidebar

If you have removed the windows synchronization client but still have the owncloud shortcut or symbol in the windows navigation side bar, 
here is how you can remove it:

1. Open `regedit`. (press the Windows Key and type regedit)
2. Search (CTL+F) for the name of the client, in this case `owncloud `.
3. Press `F3` for next search result.
4. Look for the key `System.IsPinnedToNameSpaceTree`.
5. Right click on the key name, change, set to `0` instead of `1`.

You have to do this twice. Once for the `x64` and `x32` system settings.

Once this is done, you don't even need a reboot, just open and close your explorer - the sidebar is clean.
