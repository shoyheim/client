The ownCloud Client reads a configuration file.
You can locate this configuration file as follows:

[cols="25%,75%",options="header"]
|===
| System
| Location

| *Linux* 
| `$HOME/.config/ownCloud/owncloud.cfg`
| *Microsoft Windows* 
| `%APPDATA%\ownCloud\owncloud.cfg`
| *macOS* 
|`$HOME/Library/ApplicationSupport/ownCloud/owncloud.cfg`
|===

The configuration file contains settings using {ini-file-format-url}[the Microsoft Windows `.ini` file format].
You can overwrite changes using the ownCloud configuration dialog.

NOTE: Use caution when making changes to the ownCloud Client configuration file. Incorrect settings can produce unintended results.

Some interesting values that can be set on the configuration file are:
