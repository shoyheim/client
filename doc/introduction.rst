Introduction
============

Available for Windows, Mac OS X, and various Linux distributions, the ownCloud 
Desktop Sync client enables you to:

- Specify one or more directories on your computer that you want to synchronize
  to the ownCloud server.
- Always have the latest files synchronized, wherever they are located.

Your files are always automatically synchronized between your ownCloud server 
and local PC.

.. note:: Because of various technical issues, desktop sync clients older than 
   1.7 will not allowed to connect and sync with the ownCloud 8.1+ server. It 
   is highly recommended to keep your client updated.
